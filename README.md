My text adventures from the 1980s and 1990s

### Text Adventures by Simon Avery
I wrote a lot of text adventures during the 80’s and early 90’s for the Amstrad CPC and PC which were converted to the Spectrum and C64 by Tony Collins (Guild), Anthony Reynolds (Adventure Workshop) and Dorothy Millard. Many sold commercially (some through Joan Pancott's Witch of Wessex label) and many were released as public domain. (Known today as Freeware)

Good times, a good bunch of folks involved in the UK textie scene at that time.

I have released all my text adventures up until 2004 as public domain. All copyright notices are void insofar as they apply to me.

A zip file is freely available containing all the versions I have. If you have any versions of these games that aren’t included, I’d love a copy.

Thanks to Dorothy Millard and Frederic Herlem for sending me copies of some of the following. Thanks also to Debby Howard, D. Jones and Philip Reynolds for some of the solutions.

Here follows the games, and where available, the snapshots, executable programs (PC) and sometimes even the source code. Enjoy.
